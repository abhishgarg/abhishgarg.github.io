<h3>So, who's this Abhishek Garg ?</h3>
<h4>Namaste ( नमस्ते ),</h4>

My name is Abhishek Garg. I live in [Delhi](http://www.delhitourism.gov.in/delhitourism/aboutus/index.jsp) (capital of [India](http://incredibleind  ia.org/)) and work as a software engineer @ [Wingify](https://wingify.com) a technology company who just simply believe in awesomeness.

I do practice DevOps culture and love to manage Infrastructure by code. I do support FOSS and GNU and mine favorite Desktop distos are Ubuntu and Mint and CentOS.
