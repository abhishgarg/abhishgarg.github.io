<h3>So, who's this Abhishek Garg ?</h3>
<h4>Namaste ( नमस्ते ),</h4>

<br>
I'm Engineer by profession and build things ( on jenkins :neckbeard: ) , by nature am just an another boring and lazy person who don't believe to repeat tasks and love to automate them as much possible.

I have spent 23 years (without damaging too much earth). I live in [Delhi](http://www.delhitourism.gov.in/delhitourism/aboutus/index.jsp) (capital of [India](http://incredibleind  ia.org/)). I work at [Wingify](https://wingify.com).

I'm passionate about technology, support FOSS and love Linux.
